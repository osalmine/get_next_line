# get_next_line
Hive - get_next_line

> Whether it is a file, the standard input or, later on, a network connection, you will always need to read content line by line. It is therefore time to tackle this function, which is essential for a number of your future projects.

I have provided a main for this project although the **[subject](get_next_line.en.pdf)** doesn't ask for it. You can provide your own main, but my main will print the whole file it is given.

`run.sh` will compile the project as the **[subject](get_next_line.en.pdf)** specifies.

Usage:
```
sh run.sh
./test_gnl [file]
```
